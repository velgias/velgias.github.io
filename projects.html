<h2>Data Exploration, Discovery and Recommendation through Examples</h2> 
<div class="topic-text"> 
<div id="publication"> 
Queries have been the traditional mechanism for information discovery in large datasets. They are statements expressed in formal languages and are often formulated by data engineering experts. But as data and data analysis tools are becoming more prevalent to the general public, query formulation needs to stop been a privilege of the few data experts and become a tool of the technically novice. Furthermore, data engineers may often not be aware of exactly what they are looking for, and may prefer to provide some imprecise, non-formal, and vague description. This means that there is a need for novel techniques that can fit this new way of searching. In this work we have developed a novel technique that allows searching by using examples. The user provides indicative cases of elements that are of interest and the system is able to guess from these examples the complete specifications of the data in which the user is interesting. This novel form of searching, coined as exemplar queries, is applicable to different forms of data, from textual data to structural data, or to knowledge graphs. It can go even further to recommendations. The system can guess what the user has in mind and what the final qual is, and based on that prioritize the recommendations that it makes to the user.

<h2>Trustworthy AI and Data Sustainability: Quantifying Data Quality and its effect on Data Driven Decision Making</h2>
<div class="topic-text">
<div id="publication">
	To have confidence in any data-driven decision making, there should be trust in the data on which the decision is based. 
	Unfortunately, real-world datasets have many data quality issues. 
	This is particularly true in large application domains like Health or Finance. 
	They often contain missing or incorrect values, violate constraints that should always hold, have repetitive or redundant value and outliers, may be outdated, or unreliable at best. 
	Despite a great deal of works that has been done in cleaning the data to ensuring its quality, not much work has been put into understanding the effect that data quality issues have to an analytic task at hand. 
	We measure and quantify this effect, which allows data shareholders decide if and how much they need to invest into repairing the datasets and how much trust to put on the outcomes of some analysis performed over that data. 
	<br/>
	Furthermore, we help data shareholders understand the value of the data data they collect. 
	Recent technological advances in data collection have given a significant boost to the amount, variety and the rate in which the data is nowadays collected. 
	Given that data is a comodity of our world, and data management is a resource hungly activity, it is time to start thinking about Data Sustainability.
	This, in combination with the many years of continous data collection is putting a particular strain on the storage and analytical infrastructure. 
	We help in understanding the value that different parts of the data have and the role they play in their future decision making.
	This allows the retain of only the parts that are important, in raw or some other more compact formats.

<h2>AI and Automatic, Self-service Integration of Heterogeneous Disperate Data in Privacy Regulated Environments</h2>
<div class="topic-text">
<div id="publication">
	To take informative decisions, one needs to be rely on data that describes in details and from different perspectives what happens in real world. 
	Unfortunately, such information is rarely found in one place. 
	Data needs to be collected and combined from different sources. 
	These sources have been typically developed at different times with different requirements in mind and are owned by different authorities. 
	As such, they are highly heterogeneous. 
	Furthermore, given the way that information is generated nowadays, this data is highly volatile. 
	One size fits all integration is not a practical solution any more. 
	We generate knowledge from data, study the way this knowledge involves, and create flexible integration mechanisms that can adapt to specific requirements on demand. 
	We create integrations by automatically generating the necessary code either based on high level input from users, or by automatically inferring what needs to be done given specific goals. 
	This shields data shareholders and consumers from the laboriouis, time-consuming and often error prone task if performed manually. 
	Furthemore, we develop techniques for integration on the go, with expiration. We believe that integration should take place only when it is needed, for only the parts of the data that it needs, and for as long as it is needed. 
	AI plays an important role in empowering the necessary tools for this goal. 
	<br>
	Last, but not least, we aim at providing professionals with the necessary structural knowledge to take informative decisions but since knowledge is a higly dynamic concept, we exploit this knowledge evolution and also the integration to provide a complrehensive view of the reality. 
	This can help professionals in different field and decision makes authorize or take themselves the necessary actions. 
	For instance, we build knowledge bases that help pharmaceutical authorities better understand the regulatory policies in different countries in the EU, and the effect that decisions like the approval of some specific drug will have.
